## FEATURE:

Right now the chat functionality works through the /chat command (to send a message to all other other individuals in the room the player is currently in) and through typing a message in the chat without using any command (to send a message globally). Please rework this feature so the the chat command is removed, ensuing that typing messages without commands is the only form of chatting. Also instead of sending a message globally make it so that sending a message only gets to the player on the room.
