## FEATURE:

Please help me fix these bugs. Right now the way the client handles errors is through the function `handleError`
(the client is located at `public/js/client.js`)

## EXAMPLES:

[Provide and explain examples that you have in the `examples/` folder]

## DOCUMENTATION:

[List out any documentation (web pages, sources for an MCP server like Crawl4AI RAG, etc.) that will need to be referenced during development]

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

[Any other considerations or specific requirements - great place to include gotchas that you see AI coding assistants miss with your projects a lot]
