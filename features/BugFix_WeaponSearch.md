## FEATURE:

Please help me resolve the following bug and explain me why is happening.
Right now when a player starts a weapon search, after the timer runs out the game stops, the player client stops working and the modal doesn't dissapear, but the client of the other players and the server keep running.

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

Perform tests to see that nothing has regressed.
