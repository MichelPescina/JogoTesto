## FEATURE:

The last functionality implemented was a Match System but it's necessary to create a test suite to ensure the correct behaviour of the system. 
The unit tests should cover all the new modules.
The integration tests must cover at least this cases:
- Ensure that the player can join a match.
- Ensure that a match can start after the minimum amount of players have joined.
- Ensure that the system saves the player name.
- Ensure a match ends once no players are in the match.
- Ensure a match ends once the max length of a game is achieved.
Remember that you can change the values of the variables that handle the minimum amount of player or the length of a game to a smaller value to perform the tests.

## EXAMPLES:

Research if necessary.

## DOCUMENTATION:

Research if necessary.

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

Explain the reason behind your design choices inside comments in the code.
You MUST Separate the functionality into modules ensure easy integration in the feature.
If it's appropiate refactor file into submodules if its longer than 500 lines.
Instead of recreating functionality use already existing functions, module, classes, etc.
